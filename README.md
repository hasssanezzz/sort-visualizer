# Sort Visualizer

This project is a web-based sorting visualization tool that allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms. It provides an interactive interface to understand how different sorting algorithms work and compare their performance.

### Introduction

The project aims to provide a visual representation of sorting algorithms to help users understand their inner workings. It is implemented as a web application using JavaScript, making it accessible on different platforms and devices.

### Features

* Visualize various sorting algorithms in action.
* Randomize input array with custom size.
* Adjustable speed to control the animation.
* Step-by-step mode for a detailed understanding of the sorting process.
* Highlight key steps and comparisons during sorting.
